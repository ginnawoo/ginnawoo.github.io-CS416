This scene shows the distribution of billionaires by country, with bubble sizes representing the number of billionaires and colors representing different countries. It highlights interesting insights, such as the United States having the highest number of billionaires and Japan having the oldest average age of billionaires. This visualization emphasizes the global distribution of wealth and the disparities between countries.
